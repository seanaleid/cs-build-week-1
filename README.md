### Conway's Game of Life
### This is an implementation of John Horton Conway's Game of Life written in React. 

- The project is hosted at: https://seans-game-of-life.vercel.app/
- This version of Conway's Game of Life takes advantage of hooks to handle state for the app.
- This project applies Immer's built-in default function, "produce", to manage double-buffering when the grid switches from one generation to another.
- Additionally, each generation is saved in a cache so that a player can easily view previous boards after the animation has started and been paused. 

### Core Technical Concepts/Inspiration

- This implementation was an exercise in using React Hooks and Immer to create a game following the rules from Conway's Game of Life. 

### TODO
- I need to make the app fully responsive for mobile devices.
- I would like to add the ability to "jump" to a generation input by the user without having to "play" the animation.
- I would like to include functionality that changes the dimensions of the board.
